Some thoughts.

- Watcher: get some excellent plays on YouTube, and "watch" them.
  - extract information from videos
  - under what circumstances, the knight did what
    - circumstances: positions, room shape, objects
    - the knight: moves, attack, jump, dash, focus, spell, swordart

- Teacher: train a neural network based on the Watcher's output.
  - input: the circumstances
  - output: the move of the knight (in key events)

- Beast: hunt bosses based on the Teacher's work.
  - reenforcement learning?
    - rewards
      - stand still
      - hit/spell damage/swordart success
      - success focus
      - counter
    - penalties
      - time increases
      - get damage

- Nightmare Core: OS-related dirty work
  - X window capturing
  - keycode hooks/virtual input device
  - bridge between dreamers and godseeker
  - maybe I'll need a steamOS?

Disclaimer: I will finish the pantheon of the hallownest before launching any
valid results.
