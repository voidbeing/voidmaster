- dream.ko seems working!

Since this is quite environment-dependent, the general flow will be:

1. patch kernel and use it.  
   Expose the input_dev_list from drivers/input/input.c
2. evtest
   find out the keycode of the device
3. a module (or eventually a systemcall).
   input_event(dev,     // this should be obtained from scanning input_dev_list
               EV_KEY,  // constant
               keycode, // known from evtest
               value)   // 0 is press, 1 is release
4. input_sync(dev)

There should be some kind of trigger to enable/disable the whole virtual input
things, or it will be a mess and out of control.

- dream.ko

A character device.  Should try to expose input_handler_list, then
be able to issue input_event() directly, and see what will happen.

Add new working item: Void.  Void aims to learn some self-knowledge
first, so that watcher can have prior knowledge of the knight, and 
focus on interpret the observed situation.

Some parts of beast and nightmare core involve in this taks.

- some experiments, but all seem not effective
  - continuous frames as a volume to perform a FFT3
  - frames' averag and diff to perform a FFT2

- enemies are not all objects, some attacks are beams

- let's transform videos into frams first

Some thoughts.

- Watcher: get some excellent plays on YouTube, and "watch" them.
  - extract information from videos
  - under what circumstances, the knight did what
    - circumstances: positions, room shape, objects
    - the knight: moves, attack, jump, dash, focus, spell, swordart

- Teacher: train a neural network based on the Watcher's output.
  - input: the circumstances
  - output: the move of the knight (in key events)

- Beast: hunt bosses based on the Teacher's work.
  - reenforcement learning?
    - rewards
      - stand still
      - hit/spell damage/swordart success
      - success focus
      - counter
    - penalties
      - time increases
      - get damage

- Nightmare Core: OS-related dirty work
  - X window capturing
  - keycode hooks/virtual input device
  - bridge between dreamers and godseeker
  - maybe I'll need a steamOS?

Disclaimer: I will finish the pantheon of the hallownest before launching any
valid results.
