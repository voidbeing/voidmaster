- User space 
  - send action from beast to kernel
  - send from kernel reward/penalty to beast
  - being as part of beast will be easier

- Kernel space
  - generate fake key event to the game
  - capture sound effect (is this even possible?)
    - if OK, this can be the reward/penalty front end
    - if not OK, we still have (time, life)
      - timing is tricky
